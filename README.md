# Brainwave Matrix Internship - Task 1

This repository contains Task 1 of the Brainwave Matrix Solutions Internship Program.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkayalan/retail-sales-data?resource=download).  
It contains detailed **retail sales records** including:

- `product_id`: Unique identifier for each product  
- `store_id`: Identifier of the store where the sale occurred  
- `date`: Date of the transaction  
- `sales`: Quantity of product sold  
- `revenue`: Total revenue generated  
- `stock`, `price`: Inventory and pricing info  
- `promo_type_x` and `promo_discount_x`: Promotional details applied during the sale  

The dataset covers multiple dimensions of retail operations, making it suitable for time series analysis, RFM segmentation, customer behavior insights, and demand forecasting.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

The goal of this task is to explore and analyze the retail sales dataset using Python and data visualization tools.  
The project covers:
- Cleaning and preparing the data
